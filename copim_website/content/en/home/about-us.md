Initially formed around the [Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs [COPIM] project (2019–2023)](https://copim.pubpub.org/copim-project), the Copim community continues to grow and develop through its work on the [Open Book Futures project (2023–2026)](https://copim.pubpub.org/open-book-futures-project) and its wider activities.

The Copim community research projects—COPIM and Open Book Futures—were both made possible thanks to grants from the following funders:

[Arcadia](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/) – Arcadia is a charitable foundation that works to protect nature, preserve cultural heritage and promote open access to knowledge. Since 2002 Arcadia has awarded more than $1 billion to organizations around the world.

[Research England Development (RED) Fund (UKRI)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/research-england/) – a fund supporting institutional-level innovative projects in research and knowledge exchange including collaborations between education providers and between education providers and business.
