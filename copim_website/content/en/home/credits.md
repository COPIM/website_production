This website was designed by [Simon Bowie](https://simonxix.com). It uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and served through the [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) web server. Non-English language translations are provided by [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/), a free and open source machine translation API, using a [script for batch translation of Markdown files](https://github.com/SimonXIX/Markdown_translation) developed by Simon Bowie. 

The Hugo theme is [Inate](https://github.com/COPIM/inate-hugo) which combines the Hugo themes [Introduction](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction) designed by [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev) and [Slate](https://github.com/gesquive/slate) designed by [Gus Esquivel](https://github.com/gesquive). Thanks to both designers for sharing and openly licensing their work.
