**[Opening the Future](https://www.openingthefuture.net/)** is an affordable collective subscription model for libraries, broadening your collections and funding further open access publishing.

Building on library journal subscription models and successful book membership programmes, Opening the Future funds new open access (OA) books that are available to everyone. By leveraging the collective contributions of academic libraries worldwide, we're reshaping how knowledge is funded and accessed. By joining Opening the Future, your library gains valuable benefits and no single institution bears a disproportionate burden. For a modest annual fee your library gets DRM-free, unlimited access to a selection of a publisher's backlist, with perpetual access after three years. The membership revenue is used by the publisher solely to produce new OA monographs, moving towards an affordable, sustainable model for academic publishing.
