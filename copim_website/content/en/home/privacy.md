Copim (Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs) is an international partnership of researchers, universities, librarians, open access book publishers and infrastructure providers. This privacy policy explains how our project uses the data we collect from you when you use our website.

## Data

### What data do we collect?

Copim deliberately minimises the amount of information we collect for users of our website. We keep a minimal amount of non-identifying information for the purpose of tracking web analytics.

We currently collect and process the following information for each user of our website:
 - anonymized IP address from which they accessed the site
 - approximate geolocation based on the IP address
 - operating system and web browser used to access the site
 - date and time that the user accessed the site
 - which site referred the user to the site
 - which pages on the site the user accessed

### How do we store your data?

Your data is gathered by [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) web server access logs and are automatically passed to [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) for analysis. All your information is securely stored on our virtual server hosted by Coventry University Digital Services.

We keep anonymized IP address data for two months. We then dispose of your information by automatically removing IP address data from our logs using the ipv6loganon utility in the [ipv6calc](https://www.deepspace6.net/projects/ipv6calc.html) package.

### How will we use your data?

Your anonymized data will only be used in aggregate to draw usage trends of our website in order to report to our funders. These analytics may be shared with the [Research England Development (RED) Fund](https://re.ukri.org/funding/our-funds-overview/research-england-development-red-fund/) and [Arcadia](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/), a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.
