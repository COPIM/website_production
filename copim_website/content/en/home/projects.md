### Open Book Futures

**[Open Book Futures](http://openbookfutures.copim.ac.uk/)** is a project to significantly expand key infrastructures created by COPIM to achieve a step change in how community-owned open access book publishing is delivered.

Open Book Futures will follow the principles of ‘Scaling Small’ that guided the work of the COPIM project, further developing the infrastructures, business models, networks and resources that are needed to deliver a future for Open Access books led not by large commercial operations, but by communities of scholars, small-to-medium-sized publishers, not-for-profit infrastructure providers, and scholarly libraries.

Open Book Futures is supported by the Research England Development (RED) Fund, and Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.

### COPIM

**COPIM (Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs)** was an international research project bringing together researchers, universities, librarians, open access book publishers and infrastructure providers. It built community-owned, open systems and infrastructures to enable open access book publishing to flourish.

COPIM ran from November 2019 to April 2023 and was supported by the Research England Development (RED) Fund, and Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.
