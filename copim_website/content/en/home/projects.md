### COPIM (2019–2023)

The **COPIM (Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs)** research project ran from November 2019 to April 2023, and was funded by the Research England Development (RED) Fund and Arcadia. The project formed an international partnership of researchers, universities, librarians, open access publishers and infrastructure providers, all united by a desire to enable open access book publishing to flourish.
