### Thoth

Thoth (/toʊt, θoʊθ/, Greek Θώθ < Coptic Ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ < Egyptian ḏḥwtj) is a metadata management and dissemination system for open access books. Written purely in rust, it consists of:

* A [GraphQL API](https://api.thoth.pub/), implementing a data model specifically designed for OA books
* A [REST API](https://export.thoth.pub/) to export metadata in formats like ONIX, MARC, etc.
* A [WebAssembly GUI](https://thoth.pub/) to manage metadata records.

This software is made available under open source licenses at [https://github.com/thoth-pub/](https://github.com/thoth-pub/).
