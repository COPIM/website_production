### Toolkit for Small and Scholar-Led Open Access Publishers

The **[Toolkit for Small and Scholar-Led Open Access Publishers](https://toolkit.openbookcollective.org/)** s a resource to help people who want to set up such a press or existing publishers wanting to improve the way they operate. It is published and maintained by the Open Book Collective and was launched in May 2023.

### Experimental Publishing Compendium

The **[Experimental Publishing Compendium](https://compendium.copim.ac.uk/)** is a guide and reference for scholars, publishers, developers, librarians and designers who want to challenge, push and redefine the shape, form and rationale of scholarly books. The compendium brings together tools, practices and books to promote the publication of experimental scholarly works.

### Opening the Future: How to Implement an Equitable Revenue Model for Open Access Monographs

The Opening the Future model presents a potential route for the mass and sustainable transition to OA of many small-to-mid sized university presses. Liverpool University Press and Central European University Press are both successfully running the programme and as of the end of the first phase of COPIM had together accrued enough library funding to produce 20+ new OA monographs with many more in the pipeline. Opening the Future continues to grow with both publishers. One of the final deliverables for Work Package 3 was to produce a toolkit report which outlines, in detail, exactly how we implemented this model, including the documentation of challenges, resources, timetables, and activities. This toolkit report can be read and downloaded at DOI [10.5281/zenodo.7003979](https://zenodo.org/record/7003979).
