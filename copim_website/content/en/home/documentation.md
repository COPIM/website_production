### PubPub

Copim uses PubPub for our [main documentation and updates site](https://copim.pubpub.org/). Our open documentation is intended to provide discoverable and reusable insight into the development of community-owned infrastructure for the publication of open access books.

### Zenodo

[Our community collection on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/copim/) serves as a hub for official outputs generated by the Copim community, including reports and presentations.

### GitHub

Copim believes that open access and open source are interconnected and has made all the software created during its various projects open source licensed. [Our GitHub repositories](https://github.com/COPIM) contain these various tools and scripts including our [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website and themes, the Docker Compose config for our main applications server, various backup scripts, and custom software for experimental publishing.
