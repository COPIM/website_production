### PubPub

Copim uses PubPub for our [main documentation and updates site](https://copim.pubpub.org/). Our open documentation is intended to provide discoverable and reusable insight into the development of community-owned infrastructure for the publication of open access books.

### Zenodo

[Our community collection on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/copim/) serves as a hub for official output (reports, deliverables, presentations) generated during the project's lifespan (November 2019 - April 2023).
